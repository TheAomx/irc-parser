IRC Parser  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheAomx/irc-parser.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/TheAomx/irc-parser)
==========
This is a reentrant and asynchronous IRC parser written in C. It is capable of
parsing messages from IRC servers and clients. It is modeled after Ryan Dahl's
HTTP Parser library and was originally designed to be used with libuv for
RethinkIRCd.

Warning
-----
This library has not reached 1.0 and it's API is subject to dramatic change
until both it and RethinkIRCd mature.


Documentation
-------------
The best and most recent documentation can be found inline in the header file
([here](https://github.com/TheAomx/irc-parser/blob/master/irc_parser.h))

I'll develop a method to automate the abstraction of the inline documentation
and parse it into the README here and also to dedicated a third party doc site.
This is far from the highest of priorities right now though.

High Value Targets
------------------
 * Create documentation site and clean up this README
